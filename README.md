## Description

CodeBusters is a full-stack web application that allows developers of all technical backgrounds to create and apply to coding gigs. The motivation behind our app was to create a useful, responsive and interactive tool that would support freelance work within the tech world. 

## Installation

- node.js needs to be installed prior to use
- open terminal
- clone the repo
- cd into new directory
- download JSON packages by entering `npm i`
- create a dotenv file
- enter `npm run dev` to begin the server
- run application on localhost:5000 in the browser or use the heroku link

## Usage

When a user enters our application, they are initially presented the homepage - which contains a navbar at the top of the interface and a search bar at the center of the page.

Users are able to immediately search for gigs by simply writing the name of the technologies they are proficient in. This will then render all active gigs with that particular technology with the all of necessary information pertaining to that gig. The rendered gig card will also have an 'apply' button. Users can click onto this in order to email the client. 

Futhermore, users are able to create accounts with us through the sing-up/login feature. This will allows users to access an extra feature: the 'Add Gigs' feature. This component allows clients to create and add gigs to the application.
